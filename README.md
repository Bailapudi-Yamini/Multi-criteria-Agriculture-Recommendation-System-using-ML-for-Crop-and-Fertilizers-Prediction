# Multi-criteria-Agriculture-Recommendation-System-using-ML-for-Crop-and-Fertilizers-Prediction
Agriculture holds a vital position in the economies of developing nations like India and significantly contributes to their gross domestic product (GDP). The rising population has led to increased food demand. Challenges such as selecting crops, fertilizers, and pesticides without considering various factors like soil types, water needs, temperature conditions, and profitability analysis for specific regions can result in lower crop quality, yield, and profitability. 
With advancements in computational technologies, researchers are developing methods to recommend crops based on soil conditions, water requirements, and market profitability, along with recommending fertilizers, identifying diseases, and suggesting pesticides. This research introduces a machine learning-based crop and fertilizer recommendation system named AgriRec. 
Utilizing soil properties, water levels, farm sizes, and minimum support prices of crops, we developed a machine learning model that predicts suitable crops for different seasons. Additionally, we propose a mechanism that analyzes soil, crop, and fertilizer properties to recommend optimal fertilizer combinations for given soil-crop pairs. 
Our algorithm, successfully recommends crops with 95.85% accuracy and fertilizers with 92.11% accuracy, outperforming existing benchmark recommendation methods by four times.
